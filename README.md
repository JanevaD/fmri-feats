Each folder name represents the preprocessing applied 
- networks means that there are 7 bars on the plot for each of the functional networks
- all means there are 8 bars on the plots, 7 for the functional networks, 1 unnamed for the subcortical structures

I included the scripts that computed the plots in the repository, feat_plots.py authomaticaly plotting the features, plot.py a plotting script, and FeatureExtraction script for computing the features.
